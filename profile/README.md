# Discontinuation notice
This fork was created as an attempt for [replacement of discord.py](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1). As of April 2022, 
[discord.py was resumed](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/c4324f17a80c94776832430007ad40e6) and as such, This fork no longer serves any purpose and has been discontinued.

Consider using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) instead.
